## What is this?
Video game collections is a small project that allow you to create your own video game lists.\
![demo](readme_files/demo.gif?raw=true "Demo")

## Why?

Web pages like *letterboxd* offer you the possibility to make movie listings, add reviews, ratings, and other *social media like* features.\
I love videogames and I never heard of a place like this focused on one of my favorite hobbies, so I made one.
